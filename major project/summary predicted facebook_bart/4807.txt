The Punjab Panchayat Samitis, Zilla Parishads (Haryana Amendment) Act, 1973 introduced extensive amendments in the Act of 1961. Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act. As a result of the deletion of section 33, the Panchyat Samiti lost its power to make appointments. The appellant was, therefore, entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk.
